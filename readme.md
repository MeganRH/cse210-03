CSE 210-03 Cycle

Cycle is a game where the players try to cut each other off using cycles that leave a trail behind them.

Instructions:

 Red Player: W(up), S(down), A(left) and D(right) keys to move.
Blue Player: I(up), K(down), J(left) and L(right) keys move.

The game is over when a player hit the trail.

Note: We use the snake game as a base to code the Cycle game,
